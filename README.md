# AlphaNeural AI Application

## Backend
* _User Authentication and Authorization System: Implement a secure login system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for user authentication and role-based access control._
* Database Design and Management: Set up databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user data, uploaded datasets, AI models, and blockchain transaction records.
* API for Data Upload: Develop RESTful APIs to handle the uploading of data by users in various formats (CSV, JSON, XML, images, text files).
* Data Validation and Processing Service: Create services to validate the format and integrity of the uploaded data, and preprocess it for storage and training.
* Blockchain Integration: Implement solana for storing data verification records and transaction management.
* Smart Contract Development: Write smart contracts for handling data verification, token distribution, and other blockchain-based operations.
* Distributed Computing Management: Develop a system to manage and distribute AI training tasks across the network of user-contributed compute resources.
* Resource Sharing API: Build APIs to enable users to share their computing resources, managing connections, and data transfers efficiently.
* AI Training Module: Design and implement an AI training module, including frameworks for model development, training parameter settings, and automated optimizations.
* Bias Detection and Ethical AI Compliance: Integrate tools for bias detection in AI models and ensure compliance with ethical AI standards.
* Data Security and Encryption: Implement robust security measures, including encryption, for protecting data during transfer and processing.
* Monitoring and Logging System: Set up a system for monitoring the application's performance and logging errors or security breaches.
* Load Balancing and Resource Optimization: Develop algorithms for efficient load balancing and resource utilization during distributed computing tasks.
* API Rate Limiting and Caching: Implement rate limiting on your APIs to prevent abuse and caching to improve performance.
* Compliance and Legal Module: Ensure the backend supports compliance with various data protection and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).

## Frontend

* User Interface for Account Creation and Login: Design user-friendly interfaces for account creation, login, and profile management.
* Data Upload Interface: Create an intuitive interface for users to upload data, including support for various file formats.
* Interactive Dashboard for Data Management: Develop a dashboard for users to manage their uploaded data, view verification status, and access blockchain records.
* AI Model Training Interface: Design interfaces for users to select, configure, and train AI models, including parameter settings and progress tracking.
* Visualization Tools: Implement data visualization tools for users to view insights from their data and the AI training process.
* User Interface for Compute Resource Sharing: Create a section for users to manage and monitor their contribution of computing resources.
